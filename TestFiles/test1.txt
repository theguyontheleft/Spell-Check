Is this a question?
This is a statement.
This is silly!
If your program can spell check these correctly;
you are off to a good start!

Here are some of the most common words that are spelled
(or spelt!) differently in American and British English:

American: color, flavor, honor, neighbor, rumor, labor, humor
British: colour, flavour, honour, neighbour, rumour, labour, humour

Other examples:
American English and British English both retain the noun - verb 
distinction in advice - advise and device - devise (where the pronunciation 
is (ess) for the noun and (zee) for the verb), but American 
English has abandoned the distinction with licence: license and practice: 
practise (where the two words in each pair are homophones) that British 
spelling retains. American English uses license 
and practice for both meanings.

American English has kept the Anglo-French spelling for defense 
and offense, which are usually defence and offence in British English; 
similarly there are the American pretense and British pretence; but 
derivatives such as defensive, offensive, and pretension are always 
thus spelled in both systems.

American and Canadian spelling accepts only -ize endings in most cases, 
such as organize, realize, and recognize!
British usage is split between both (ize) and (ise) (organize: organise, 
realize: realise, recognize: recognise), and the ratio between (ise) and 
(ize) stands at 3:2 in the British National Corpus.
In Australia and New Zealand (ise) spellings strongly prevail: the 
(-ise) form is preferred in Australian English at a ratio of about 
3:1 according to the Dictionary.

The distribution of -yse and -yze endings, as in analyse: analyze, is 
different from (-ise) (-ize): (-yse) is British and (-yze) is American. 
Thus, in British English analyse, catalyse, hydrolyse, and paralyse, 
but in American English analyze, catalyze, hydrolyze, and paralyze.

My favorites, or is it favourites?
aeroplane  airplane
moustache mustache
pyjamas pajamas
speciality specialty

I guess that you can spell it either "moustache" or "mustache" in 
American English; but not in British English!
